Amazing game that was NOT made in less than 25 hours

Created with PyGame

This is a 2-player game, 
Player 1 the Runner controls wasd, and
Player 2 the Hunter controls Arrow keys and the mouse

The goal of the Runner is to survive for as long as they can, and
The goal of the Hunter is to kill the Runner by getting close and clicking on them

The game is verry buggy and will most likely never be fixed
